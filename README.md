# Technologies
## Front-End (Angular 15)
- Angular: Utilized as the front-end framework, leveraging the latest version (Angular 15) to build a highly interactive and responsive user interface.
- Bootstrap: Used to enhance the UI with pre-styled, responsive components for a polished look and feel across devices.
- Reactive Forms: Provides dynamic form handling, allowing real-time validation and improved user interactions.
- RxJS: Utilized to manage asynchronous operations and handle data streams, ensuring a responsive experience for users.
- Toastr: A highly customizable notification system to provide real-time feedback to users for actions like successful product additions or error messages.
- AOS (Animate On Scroll): Utilized for adding smooth and visually appealing scroll animations to enhance the user experience as users scroll through product listings and pages.

## Back-End (ASP.NET Core 5)
- ASP.NET Web API: The back-end is built using ASP.NET Core, offering a scalable and robust server-side infrastructure for managing business logic, data, and API endpoints.
- Entity Framework Core: The application leverages Entity Framework Core for ORM-based data access, simplifying CRUD operations, and providing powerful querying capabilities while managing interactions with SQL Server.
- JWT Token Authentication: Implements secure user authentication using JWT tokens, ensuring protected access to various resources within the app.
- Role-Based Authorization: Integrates role-based access control to ensure secure and tailored user access to different parts of the application.

## Database
FreshCart utilizes SQL Server for its relational data storage. 
Entity Framework Core simplifies database operations by providing an ORM-based approach to interact with the SQL Server database, abstracting raw SQL queries into more manageable code with LINQ support.

## Design Patterns
The application utilizes SOLID design principles and several key design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability:
- Dependency Injection: Promotes loose coupling and enhances testability by injecting dependencies into classes.
- Repository Pattern: Provides an abstraction layer for database access, ensuring separation between business logic and data access.
- Singleton: Ensures that certain services, like HTTP services, are instantiated only once throughout the application’s lifecycle.
- Decorator: Used for extending and adding functionality to objects without modifying their structure.

## Deployment
FreshCart is deployed using various Azure services and external platforms:
- Azure SQL Database: The application’s relational data is stored in a fully-managed SQL Server database on Azure.
- Azure App Services: The back-end API is deployed on Azure App Services for secure, scalable hosting.
- Azure Storage (Blob): Images and static assets are stored and served from Azure Blob Storage.
- Netlify: The Angular frontend is deployed on Netlify for fast, static site hosting with automatic CI/CD integration.
